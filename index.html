			<h2>Risography</h2>
			<section>
				<h2>Process</h2> <!--Deze H2 moet ontzichtbaar worden-->
				<p>
					The Risograph is a stencil duplicator machine that works in a similar way to screen printing. 
					It creates a stencil from banana paper, this is then wrapped around an ink drum and soy ink is 
					pushed through the voids of the stencil. As the paper glides over the rotating drum it imprints 
					your artwork onto its surface. The colours are then layered up to create your masterpiece!
				</p>
				<p>
					Riso is the only environmentally friendly form of printing and when you work with Dopple you 
					should know that's taken seriously. Dopple only stocks 100% recycled, unbleached paper and 
					compostable packaging. Everything in the studio is reused and recycled at every opportunity! 
					Hence all the Ink canister lamp.
				</p>
				<p><strong>TL:DR  It's a cool eco-friendly screen printing machine</strong></p>

				<h2>History</h2> <!--Deze H2 moet ontzichtbaar worden-->
				<p>
					Risograph printing originated, in the 1980s, brought into the world by the RISO Kagaku Corporation 
					(in Japanese, 'Riso' means 'ideal' and the word 'Kagaku' means 'science). This amazing machine was 
					initially created as  speedy, low cost, high volume duplicator for churches, prisons and political 
					campaigns. Its user base has shifted in the past decade as creatives have since repurposed the machine- 
					harnessing its quirks and unusual colour pallet in order to make beautiful vibrant art prints. Using 
					Riso in this new way has enabled artists to create stencil prints with an aesthetic akin to a screen 
					print but at a much lower price.

				<h2>FAQS</h2> <!--Deze H2 moet ontzichtbaar worden-->
				<p>
					Having been in the Riso biz for over half a decade there are some questions that tend to pop up over 
					and over so hopefully, these are of help if you have more drop an email!
				</p>
				<p><strong>What's the maximum print Size?​</strong> A3 (with a 3-5mm border)
				</p>
				<p>
					​<strong>What's the minimum quantity I can print?​</strong>
					You can print as little as one but just like a screenprint the more you run from your set up the better 
					the unit price becomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					​<strong>What are prices based on?​</strong>
					Prices are based on the no. of colour stencils, dimension, quantity and stock.
				</p>
				<p>
					​<strong>What do I need to send Dopple to create my riso print?​</strong>
					check out the 'prepping your artwork' section here!
				</p>
				<p>
					​<strong>What's the best thing to print?​</strong>
					Dopple will advise and help you to achieve a great outcome no matter your artwork but the most economical 
					pieces use few colours in higher quantities.

					Riso process, making every print unique.
